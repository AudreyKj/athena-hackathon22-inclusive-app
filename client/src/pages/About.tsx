          <p id="message">We are a women-owned business located in the heart of London's<br></br>
          Industrial Park district. We are on a mission to help new residents<br></br> 
          recently displaced due to dire world events and the low to no<br></br> 
          earners living here in the United Kingdom. <br></br><br></br>

          With the generous donations from local businesses and individuals,<br></br> 
          we are determined to close the existing technology gap. By offering<br></br>
          refurbished devices such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops, we<br></br> 
          are simultaneously helping businesses and individuals reduce<br></br> 
          electronic waste and elevate those in need. With their new-used<br></br> 
          devices, individuals can readily search for new opportunities both<br></br> 
          in work and in furthering their education, thus improving their <br></br> 
          livelihood.</p>

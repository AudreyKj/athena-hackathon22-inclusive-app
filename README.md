# Athena June 2022 Hackathon - ReconnecTech

ReconnecTech is a web app that facilitates providing refurbished electronic devices (such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops) to refugees and people with low to no means. 

The project's aim is to improve digital inclusion while reducing electronic waste at the same time.

- Businesses that donate their older devices receive tax incentive while meeting their environmental initiatives.


- Individuals who donate receive tax incentive and do their part in supporting a circular economy.


- Recipients of new used device help close the technology gap, find opportunities for work and education, while connecting with family & friends.


The app was made in only 1.5 day for the Athena Hackathon on June 11th, 2022. The Hackathon's theme was building an app that could help refugees' social inclusion and businesses' environmental initiatives. 

We collaborated as a team of 3 (Audrey, Mansi, and Lisa) to build the project from the ground up in a short time - from ideation, to prototyping and coding.
